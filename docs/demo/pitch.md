# RiskMind Pitch Script (2 Minutes)

Hello judges and jury,

Imagine an underwriter with a stack of submissions, claims histories, and policy guidelines - and just minutes to decide risk. Today that means spreadsheets, static reports, and long back-and-forths. RiskMind changes that.

RiskMind is a self-service underwriting co-pilot that turns raw claims data and unstructured evidence into clear, evidence-backed decisions. In one place, underwriters can see live portfolio risk, view anomaly alerts, and ask the DataBot direct questions like, "Why is this policy high risk?" or "Show me the loss drivers for the last 30 days." The system answers with data, citations, and an action plan.

Here is what makes RiskMind different:

First, it blends structured data and unstructured evidence. Our Co-Pilot Evidence Blend combines claims totals, loss ratios, and guideline rules with photos and videos from the claim itself. Underwriters can upload a short video, and the AI summarizes what is happening and why it matters.

Second, every insight is transparent. We show the exact SQL query and the guideline section behind each recommendation. That builds trust and makes the AI auditable.

Third, it is truly self-service. Underwriters do not wait for a data team or an analyst. They can ask the conversational DataBot, get immediate analysis, and move to a decision with confidence.

In short, RiskMind reduces time-to-decision, improves underwriting quality, and makes risk insight explainable. We are not adding another dashboard - we are giving underwriters a trusted AI teammate.

Thank you. We would love to show you RiskMind live.
